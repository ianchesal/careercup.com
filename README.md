=============

My answers to interview questions found on http://www.careercup.com/page?sort=votes

Answers are largely Python-based. The top comment in the file will indicate the URL to the question that spawned the answer work. Some files contain multiple answers to the question where I made different attempts to explore tradeoffs in answers.

The `otherstuff` directory contains some answer samples for other questions that are not from the careercup.com website. Just stuff I wanted to make sure I could do efficiently in Python for whatever reason. Where another site held a question that drove me to create the code I made a note in the top comments of the file, otherwise it was done for reasons all my own.
